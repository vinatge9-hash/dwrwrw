## Customization Guide

To customize the Ultimate Fitness Gym Website, you can modify the following components:

### 1. **Styling**:
   - **CSS Files**: Add or modify styles in an external CSS file (if any). Make sure to link it in the `<head>` section of each HTML file.
   - **Inline Styles**: You can also apply inline styles directly within the HTML elements.

### 2. **Content**:
   - Update the text and images within each HTML file to reflect the current offerings and promotions.
   - Ensure that any links to classes, memberships, or contact forms are correct and functional.

### 3. **JavaScript**:
   - If you want to add interactivity (e.g., form validation, dynamic class schedules), create a JavaScript file and link it in the `<head>` or before the closing `</body>` tag.

### 4. **Images**:
   - Replace placeholder images with high-quality images relevant to your gym. Ensure they are optimized for web use.
